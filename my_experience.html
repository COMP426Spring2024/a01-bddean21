            <li>Since middle school was the third round of buses, and the first round was already having many issues, my mom drove me home from school because her SUV had 4 wheel drive.</li>
            <li>My sister had already gotten on the bus from elementary school, but because the buses did not have 4 wheel drive, they got stuck in between 2 icy hills. My mom would have picked up my sister and her friends, but her car battery died in our driveway shortly after I got home. Her friends mom tried to pick them up in her minivan but also got stuck. Luckily, another friend's dad had a 4 wheel drive pickup truck and drove everyone home.</li>
            <li>My dad got stuck at the bottom of a hill and had to leave his car overnight at a hotel and walk 5 miles home. He later called the hotel and luckily they understood that this was an extreme circumstance and were not going to enforce parking policies during the storm.</li>
