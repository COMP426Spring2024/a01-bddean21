        <h2>This storm was so bad that it was on local news stations around the country, and national news. The interstates basically became parking lots, and the state national guard had to get involved in order to help clear out vehicles that people abandoned, and pass out MREs (military food), to those who were stranded in their vehicles. People were stranded overnight in both schools and workplaces, and overall the city was very underprepared for this. Atlanta has had similar snow events in the years after this, but now the city is prepared as soon as it shows up in the forecast in order to prevent something like this from happening again.</h2>
